During this WorkShop, we will see the _basics of csfml_.

The points covered are:
- Look the "display environnement variable"
- Creation of a window
- Event management
- Creation of a sprite
- Creation of a text

**At each step, you need to call the trainers to validate your code.**

_Don't worry, it's normal if you don't finish._

If the trainers validate your code, go to [Exercise 1](./doc/exercise1.md)
